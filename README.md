# ToDo List

Use the localStorage to create a simple todo list application

1. create a text input field and a button to add items to the list
1. clicking on an item in the list should mark it as done (you can do so by changing its style to `line-through`)
1. next to each item there should be a button to completely delete an item
1. as a bonus, add a system to change the priority of each item. Depending on the priority you could sort item differently and also dispaly them in different colors
